# Cartridge-Label-Templates
Photoshop templates for various videogame consoles

All templates are a WIP!

I've tried to add guides that make sense for the layouts of each respective type of label; magenta are edge guides, green are center guides.  If I missed anything, let me know.

Photoshop files should all be pre-sized, but for reference I've included an Excel sheet that lists the size information for each system.

Whenever possible, these have been printed and tested to verify dimensions.

If you'd like to request a template be made for a particular system cartridge, I will either need a sample cart to borrow, or clear photograph facing the label squarely, with precise measurements taken from a set of digital calipers.  I am for precision, so rulers or guessing won't work for these, sorry!
